Got stuck in the correct way to divide into 2 sets of equal sum

Could be done if we add numbers in the decreasing order greedily into setA while checking we don't end up
with a total greater than half the sum of all n numbers.

Cannot be done in the increasing order due to repeats
For n = 7
SetA sum total Target is 14
ex : 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 => X (Cannot proceed anymore)
