2 pointers on the sorted apartments and applicants
We can greedily assign apartments to get the best applicant by placing a ptr 
on each of the array and picking the smallest apartment for a applicant 
or skipping the applicant entirely
But why does greedy work here? 
Because if for each applicant (that gets picked) we assign the smallest apartment possible, 
we leave larger apartments for applicants with larger requirements
(note : TC#17 gives TLE for Java)
