Brute force approach : For every interval provided, increment the count values of 
those positions in that interval by 1. Once done, for every one of the provided intervals,
find and return the max count for all of the positions.

Clearly very slow.

Optimized approach : the operation of increamenting the count for each position in the 
interval can also be done in a better way below.

interval => 2 4

prefix_sum_arr => 0 0 1 0 -1 0 0

Doing the prefix sum of this array, will give us the same result as increment the count values of 
those positions in the interval one by one.

Using the above idea we now have to do only one iteration.
