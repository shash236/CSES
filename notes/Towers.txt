Greedy approach : For each cube we either start a new tower or 
put it on top a another tower. If we have 2 towers on which can place this cube,
we must choose the one which is smaller because that more larger cubes that can 
come later to find a tower.

If we keep the track of the top of all the towers, we get a sorted array, 
so now the tower we need to place our cube is just the upper bound
