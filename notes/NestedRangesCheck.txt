Let's order the ranges given in the example

l r
----
1 13
1 6
2 4
3 6
4 8

The intuition to solve this problem is that for the range at index i in the above sorted
to be contained any of the ranges below it should have higher right value (prefix max). 

In the same way for the same range to contain any other ranges, the any one of the ranges 
below it should have a lower right value (suffix min).

Note : In the case 2 ranges have same left value the range with greater right value occurs 
before the other since we are trying the order based on the coverage
