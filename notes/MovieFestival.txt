Greed approach : Let's pick the preferred intervals one by one based on order(in this case : time).

Suppose that 2 intervals overlap. Which is to be selected? 

We need to select the one which is closer and covers lesser distance.

For ex : [2,5] and [4,9] => they overlap, hence we need to pick any one of these intervals.
We pick [2,5] because that allows more movies to be freely watched than [4,9] (9 is much later than 5)
