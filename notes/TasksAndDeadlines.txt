For the example

3
6 10
8 15
5 12

There a 3! ways of arranging, lets calculate reward for each case; 

1 2 3 -> 10 - 6 + 15 - 14 + 12 - 19 = -2
1 3 2 -> 10 - 6 + 12 - 11 + 15 - 19 = 1
2 1 3 ...
2 3 1 ...
3 1 2 -> 12 - 5 + 10 - 11 + 15 - 19 = 2
3 2 1 ...

We see the checkpoints are always added, and the value substraction 
is the sum of the durations

So we need to choose the increasing orderer as the sum val after each task 
is the lowest in this case
