We use a stack in the solution.
The stack gives us list of available rooms.
We add all the arrival and departure times in a list , and then sort them while maintaining the customer position and +1 or -1 depending on arrival or departure.
We iterate over all the arrival and departure times.
If the current time is arrival time, we check the stack for any available room(peek).
If the stack is empty, we add a room to the stack and increase maximum rooms.
If the current time is the departure time, we re-add whatever room was assigned to the customer.
